Simple chat based on ajax XMLHttpRequest (XHR)

## About
I was thinking about chats in the browser, how can it work effectively without websockets? One time I got an idea. If I use simple ajax and set timeout to big number (for example 20 seconds), I can respond on the server side in the moment when I have new message for client. Great idea, so I started work and after +-2 hours I had first working prototype. So I invest few more hours to programming this thing and created this!
